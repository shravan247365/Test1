-Merchants are rewarding customers,customers are getting rewards ,but is that enough?? how many of us used those reward points as per our wish.-flexibility in earning and spending those reward points (we call it as zoyal points)-do u feel all reward points should accumulate without expiry at one place,u want to use zoyal points in replacement to cash.-we feel that customers are not given enough freedom to earn and spend reward points.we are in the process of creating the loyalty product that is beneficial for both consumer and merchant.-I have multiple loyalty cards but that doesn't sound good when i want to redeem because there are less points and i cab spend only at specific store,carrying lot of cards is cubersome process.
